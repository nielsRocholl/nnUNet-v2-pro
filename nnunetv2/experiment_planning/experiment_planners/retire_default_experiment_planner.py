    MOVE EVERYTHING INTO THE PLANS. MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY

    Ideally I would like to move transpose_forward/backward into the configurations so that this can also be done
    differently for each configuration but this would cause problems with identifying the correct axes for 2d. There
    surely is a way around that but eh. I'm feeling lazy and featuritis must also not be pushed to the extremes.

    So for now if you want a different transpose_forward/backward you need to create a new planner. Also not too
    hard.
